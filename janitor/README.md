# llm self trainer

this is an in-house tool used for preparing data to give to llms.

how it works:

1. you give it a list of input data
2. the ui shows you the input data
3. either,
   a. type in the correct output for that input
   b. look at the fine tuned model so far and use its output
4. fine tune every couple runs (50 runs worked for me)
